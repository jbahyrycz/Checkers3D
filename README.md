# Checkers3D
## An unfinished project of checkers game created in OpenGL.
The project was developed in Visual Studio 2022 and **supports x86 Windows architecture**. If you wish to download the files and run the solution, make sure to set your environment adequately.

After running the solution you can start a gameplay by choosing the "start" option in the menu. You can move around using arrows and Enter key. There is no logic implemented and after moving your piece, computer automatically responds with a completely random move. While in the menu you are able to run the "analysis", which recreates your last game move after move when you click the right arrow.
