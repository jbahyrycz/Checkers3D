# Checkers3D
##An unfinished project of checkers game created in OpenGL.
The project was being made in Visual Studio 2022 and **supports x86 Windows architecture**. If you wish to download the files and run the solution, make sure to set your environment adequately.
There is no logic implemented and after moving your piece, computer automatically responds with a completely random move.
After running the solution you are in the menu and you can start the gameplay by choosing the "start" option. Then you get the 3D Checkerboard with red and brown pieces. You can move your pieces using arrows and Enter on your keybord.

At the moment you can move the pieces to any square that is empty and the computer immediately responds with a random move of one of the opponent's pieces. There is neither a possibility of capturing opponent's piece nor promoting yours.
