# Checkers3D

## The final project for Software Engineering subject at 3rd semester of my university course

The project is being made in Visual Studio 2022 and supports x86 Windows architecture. If you wish to download the files and run the solution, make sure to set your environment adequately.

After running the solution you get the 3D Checkerboard with red and brown pieces. At the beginning the left bottom square is set as "active" and has a different color than the others (currently pink). You can change the active square using arrows on your keybord. When you are on the square containing the piece you want to move you can choose this piece by pressing Enter. When you have some piece chosen you move it by pressing Enter on an empty square of your choice.

At the moment you can move the pieces to any square that is empty and the computer immediately responds with a random move of one of the opponent's pieces. There is neither a possibility of capturing opponent's piece nor promoting yours. The scene looks a bit crappy, because I didn't use any models, just manually put the vertices of the objects in the code and I haven't implement any lightning yet. I intend to change all these issues and add some other functionalities in the next 2 monts and will be updating `README.md` regularly.
